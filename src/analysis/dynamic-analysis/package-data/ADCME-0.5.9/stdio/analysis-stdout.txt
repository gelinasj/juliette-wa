[✘] Dynamic library path (Optional)

[Reason]
/home/jack/.julia/conda/3/lib is not in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This MAY break custom operator compilation. However, in most cases, ADCME automatic fixes this problem for you.


[Instruction]
Add your dynamic library path path to your environment path, e.g. (Unix systems) 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/jack/.julia/conda/3/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

For convenience, you can add the above line to your `~/.bashrc` (Linux or Apple).
For Windows, you need to add it to PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

[✔️] Memory Address Length =  64
[✘] Binaries path

[Reason]
/home/jack/.julia/conda/3/bin is not in PATH. This path contains compatible tools such as a GCC compiler, `cmake`, `make`, or any other tools you want to use directly from terminal.
However, setting the path is NOT a requirement, and ADCME works totally fine without any action.


[Instruction]
(Optional) Add your binary path to your environment path, e.g. (Unix systems) 

export PATH=/home/jack/.julia/conda/3/bin:$PATH

For convenience, you can add the above line to your `~/.bashrc` (Linux) or `~/.bash_profile` (Apple).
For Windows, you need to add it to system environment.

[✘] GPU Support (Optional)

[Reason]
ADCME is not compiled against GPU.


[Instruction]
If you intend to use GPU, set ENV["GPU"] = 1 and then rebuild ADCME.
